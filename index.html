    The purpose of a search engine is to give the most relevant results to the person using it. 
    It does this by comparing several factors about the user, for example the words used in the 
    query and location, with the web pages in the search engines index.  
    
    This is why you can get different results by changing the wording.

  <p>
    For e.g. a business owner it’s important that their web page gets the highest ranking possible 
    to reach potential customers. 
  
    By learning about the specific search algorithm and using it to 
    your advantage you can improve the ranking by adapting the web page; this process is called SEO.
